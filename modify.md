this is a project we want to incorporate u with the task that we think is best for managing the next wave of engineering sciences
space programme as a clean shit of paper


# this is the test blockchain by Radii Edu Commute

- added chain hash 
- TODO: merkle tree testing
- TODO: peer to peer chaining transfers

have a look at the graphchain and bitcoin books that are available

# for sharing of test codes 

        # for generating runnable standalones [ with only binary and static library]

        cpack --config CPackConfig.cmake


the tutorial put together in this codebase but structured differently
